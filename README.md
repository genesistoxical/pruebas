## Usage
It's very easy to use, as it's an editor like any other. If you have questions about a tool or button, hover over it (without clicking) to get information.

- Open an image ![_Open](docs/assets/buttons/_Info.png) (it must be in PNG format). The margins with empty pixels will be automatically cropped.
- Start creating the arrow; use the brush, colorpicker and your creativity. Once you select the brush, you can also erase with a right-click.
- Once finished, you can add a shadow ![_Shadow](docs/assets/buttons/_Shadow.png). A lot of shading is usually added to the arrow so you can refine it by erasing a bit.
- Select ![_Hotspot](docs/assets/buttons/_Hotspot.png) from toolbar to choose where you want your cursor to click, such as the arrowhead. Click to place the circle where you want it.
- Press the save button ![_Save](docs/assets/buttons/_Save.png), put it a name, and you're done. Now let's install it...

**Installation:**
- Open your cursors folder with the ![_CursorsFolder](docs/assets/buttons/_Info.png) button and move the cursor you just created there.
- Click ![_MouseProperties](docs/assets/buttons/_MouseProperties.png), which is just a shortcut to the Windows Mouse Properties.
- In the window that opens, go to **Pointers**, click **Normal Selection** and `Browse` to choose a different one. Go to **- Pixie Cursors -** folder and select your cursor. You can do the same with the link or hand cursor.
- Press `Save As...`, put it a name and `OK`.
- Uncheck the **Enable Drop Shadow** box to avoid a double shadow, click `OK` and that's it! Enjoy your cursor!

**Other tools:**
- If **Crop Empty Margin** is enabled when opening an image, it will be cropped to get the best cursor size.
- Hold `Shift` when using brush to draw a line.
- Press `Ctrl` when using paint bucket or *Fill* to paint all pixels the same color.

By clicking on ![_Info](docs/assets/buttons/_Info.png), a new window will appear in which you can:

- **Change language:** In the **Language** section below, click on the little arrows icon to change between English or Español. Finally click on the return button to apply and see changes.
     
- **Third-party content:** On the left side are the names of each library, project, icons or fonts that were used, click one to read its license and author(s), as well as a short description. You can click on the clip icon to go to each repository/official site and change pages with **Next 🢖🢖** or **🢔🢔 Back**.

## Installer
To compile the installer you need [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), the files are located in the [installer src](/installer%20src) folder. You just need to open the project (Installer.iss) and compile it, unless you want to make a change. When finished, it will leave a folder called Output in the same location.

>* Please note that you must first compile the source code in Visual Studio to get the binaries, otherwise you will get a [📍Compiler Error](https://github.com/genesistoxical/drop-icons/issues/3).
>* Alternatively, you can download the compiled app from the Pixie Cursors [page](https://genesistoxical.github.io/pixie-cursors/).

.iss Get the files that are needed within their folder and/or the Release folder (due to relative paths).

## Contributing
* If you make comments in the code, preferably in Spanish, please.
* Variable names must be in English.
* If you open an **Issue**, it can be in English o Spanish.
* **Pull request** in English, in the description you can add details in English or Spanish.
