## Usage
It's very easy to use, as it's an editor like any other. If you have questions about a tool or button, hover over it (without clicking) to get information.

- Open an image ![Open](docs/assets/buttons/Open.png) (it must be in PNG format). The margins with empty pixels will be automatically cropped.
- Start creating the arrow; use the brush, colorpicker and your creativity. Once you select the brush, you can also erase with a right-click.
- Once finished, you can add a shadow ![Shadow](docs/assets/buttons/Shadow.png). A lot of shading is usually added to the arrow so you can refine it by erasing a bit.
- Select ![Hotspot](docs/assets/buttons/Hotspot.png) from toolbar to choose where you want your cursor to click, such as the arrowhead. Click to place the circle where you want it.
- Press the save button ![Save](docs/assets/buttons/Save.png), put it a name, and you're done. Now let's install it...

**Installation:**
- Open your cursors folder with the ![CursorsFolder](docs/assets/buttons/CursorsFolder.png) button and move the cursor you just created there.
- Click ![MouseProperties](docs/assets/buttons/MouseProperties.png), which is just a shortcut to the Windows Mouse Properties.
- In the window that opens, go to **Pointers**, click **Normal Selection** and `Browse` to choose a different one. Go to **- Pixie Cursors -** folder and select your cursor. You can do the same with the link or hand cursor.
- Press `Save As...`, put it a name and `OK`.
- Uncheck the **Enable Drop Shadow** box to avoid a double shadow, click `OK` and that's it! Enjoy your cursor!

**Other tools:**
- If **Crop Empty Margin** is enabled when opening an image, it will be cropped to get the best cursor size.
- Hold `Shift` when using brush to draw a line.
- Press `Ctrl` when using paint bucket or **Fill** to paint all pixels the same color.

By clicking on ![Info](docs/assets/buttons/Info.png), a new window will appear in which you can:

- **Change language:** In the **Language** section below, click on the little arrows icon to change between English or Español. Finally click on the return button to apply and see changes.
     
- **Third-party content:** On the left side are the names of each library, project, icons or fonts that were used, click one to read its license and author(s), as well as a short description. You can click on the clip icon to go to each repository/official site and change pages with **Next 🢖🢖** or **🢔🢔 Back**.

## Installer
To compile the installer you need [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), the files are located in the [installer src](/installer%20src) folder. You just need to open the project (Installer.iss) and compile it, unless you want to make a change. When finished, it will leave a folder called Output in the same location.

>* Please note that you must first compile the source code in Visual Studio to get the binaries, otherwise you will get a [📍Compiler Error](https://github.com/genesistoxical/drop-icons/issues/3).
>* Alternatively, you can download the compiled app from the Pixie Cursors [page](https://genesistoxical.github.io/pixie-cursors/).

.iss Get the files that are needed within their folder and/or the Release folder (due to relative paths).

## What's new?
`Version 1.1.0` when opening an image smaller than 32px that is not square, it no longer looks blurry.

`Version 1.4.1` eraser tool fixed, it wasn't working. Message displayed when opening an image while another one is already open has been improved.

`Version 1.5.2` fixed a minor issue when double-clicking the ColorPicker. The message to create a new file when opening another image has been improved, now also displays when a cursor design is on the canvas.

Regarding a Windows 10 compatibility issue (it won't open), it will be compiled on that version to fix it.

`Version 1.5.4` fixed an issue where Pixie Cursors wouldn't run using the installer. This was due to the **Config.ini** file path was incorrect when attempting to get it from AppData.
