## Usage
It's very easy to use, as it's an editor like any other. If you have questions about a tool or button, hover over it (without clicking) to get information.

- Open an image ![Open](assets/buttons/Open.png) (it must be in PNG format). The margins with empty pixels will be automatically cropped.
- Start creating the arrow; use the brush, colorpicker and your creativity. Once you select the brush, you can also erase with a right-click.
- Once finished, you can add a shadow ![Shadow](assets/buttons/Shadow.png). A lot of shading is usually added to the arrow so you can refine it by erasing a bit.
- Select ![Hotspot](assets/buttons/Hotspot.png) from toolbar to choose where you want your cursor to click, such as the arrowhead. Click to place the circle where you want it.
- Press the save button ![Save](assets/buttons/Save.png), put it a name, and you're done. Now let's install it...

**Installation:**
- Open your cursors folder with the ![CursorsFolder](assets/buttons/CursorsFolder.png) button and move the cursor you just created there.
- Click ![MouseProperties](assets/buttons/MouseProperties.png), which is just a shortcut to the Windows Mouse Properties.
- In the window that opens, go to **Pointers**, click **Normal Selection** and `Browse` to choose a different one. Go to **- Pixie Cursors -** folder and select your cursor. You can do the same with the link or hand cursor.
- Press `Save As...`, put it a name and `OK`.
- Uncheck the **Enable Drop Shadow** box to avoid a double shadow, click `OK` and that's it! Enjoy your cursor!

**Other tools:**
- If **Crop Empty Margin** is enabled when opening an image, it will be cropped to get the best cursor size.
- Hold `Shift` when using brush to draw a line.
- Press `Ctrl` when using paint bucket or **Fill** to paint all pixels the same color.
