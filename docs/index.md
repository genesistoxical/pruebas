Pixie Folders is a set of six minimalist icon designs that include editable files. Each one is created as pixel-perfect for the `Large icons` view, by customizing a Windows folder.

They are available in SVG, PSD, AFDESIFG, PNG and ICO formats. For these last two, a palette of seven colors was chosen considering light and dark mode; aqua, black, blue, pink, purple, salmon and yellow.
